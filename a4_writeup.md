# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
the hardest thing to make was slicing up the horizontal and diagonal ways of winning 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I am unsure 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I might teach the computer what the winning combinations are, and then set specified if statements for if a combonation ends up getting disrupted by the player.
